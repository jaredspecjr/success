## Self Assessment
1. I'm kind of afraid of the job search due to the fact I just moved here and I know nothing of the businesses  surrounding me. While I feel better about technical interviews(thanks for the help Tyler!) I'm still nervous about the whole process. But I think interviews in general for me have always been nerve racking.
Honestly I'm not sure what would make me feel more confident. But one things for sure.. I need to find out more about the surrounding businesses and what they do/stand for.


2. I guess I do feel unprepared for the job search in general. I've never done a cover letter before. I don't even know where to begin(will be working on that today). I'm afraid.. of the unknown. I'd like to study more javascript and react before I even try to search for a job. which I've been trying to do in my spare time.


## Make a Plan
1. Search for info about the surrounding businesses and what they do.
2. Focus on writing a good cover letter, i have a lot of questions about it.
3. Focus on making a resume.
4. Focus on finishing my linkedIn.
5. Continue sprucing up github.
6. Study an extra Javascript course
7. Study an extra React course
8. Make a few projects in react
